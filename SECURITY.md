# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Syncd is currently in open beta. Upstream patches are routinely applied to the most recent release. Beta testers/evaluators are strongly encouraged to update frequently.

The syncd maintainers lookforward to a GA release, at which point we expect to maintain a well-defined supported-version matrix.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The syncd maintainers routinely perform careful peer review, static code analysis and dependency vulnerability scanning on the syncd codebase, but no developer or automated tool is infallable. As active participants in the security research community ourselves, we value the time and effort of our fellow researchers, and are deeply grateful for the responsible disclosure of vulnerabilites.

If you believe you have identified a vulnerability in syncd, please initiate a report by emailing [dhenderson@teamraft.com](mailto:dhenderson@teamraft.com?subject=Syncd%20Vulnerability%20Disclosure) with the subject "Syncd Vulnerability Disclosure".
